# Stock-Price-Prediction-with-LSTM


I have used libraries like: Pandas, yfinance, Keras, Tensorflow, Numpy.

I have used two layers of LSTM model and Two layers of Dense model.
I have trained the model in 30 epochs.
This code is in Python and this code gives the Stock Prices prediction for Apple products.
